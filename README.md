# RobotC Drink Mixer

This is RobotC code used to program a drink mixing robot for an engineering design project.

It used a Lego Mindstroms EV3 brick to control 3 EV3 motors and two Tetrix servos.

### Features of the robot design used with this code included:

- Two 500 mL liquid containers, which could be filled and drained(a file is automatically updated based off the changing values of liquid in the containers)
- A stirring rod that could rotate into the cup and mix the two liquids
- A platform that rotated the cup below the two containers and the mixing rod
